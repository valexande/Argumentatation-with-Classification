This package provides CFFI-based bindings to the clingo solver.

Clingo is part of the [Potassco](https://potassco.org) project for *Answer Set Programming* (ASP).
ASP offers a simple and powerful modeling language to describe combinatorial problems as *logic programs*.
The *clingo* system then takes such a logic program and computes *answer sets* representing solutions to the given problem.
To get an idea, check our [Getting Started](https://potassco.org/doc/start/) page and the [online version](https://potassco.org/clingo/run/) of clingo.

Please check the the [API documentation](https://potassco.org/clingo/python-api/current/clingo/) on how to use this module.
